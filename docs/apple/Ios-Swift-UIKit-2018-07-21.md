swift4기반으로 공부중이며, 처음 공부하는것으로 처음 문법으로 차례대로 정리 해보았습니다. 
공부할때 내용에 대해서는 xcode > developer document를 참조했습니다.

### Foundation
Access essential data types, collections, and operating-system services to define the base layer of functionality for your app.

_Overview_<br>
The Foundation framework provides a base layer of functionality for apps and frameworks, including data storage and persistence, text processing, date and time calculations, sorting and filtering, and networking. The classes, protocols, and data types defined by Foundation are used throughout the macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS SDKs.

- Fundamentals
> Numbers, Data, and Basic Values
Work with primitive values and other fundamental types used throughout Cocoa.

Strings and Text
Create and process strings of Unicode characters, use regular expressions to find patterns, and perform natural language analysis of text.

Collections
Use arrays, dictionaries, sets, and specialized collections to store and iterate groups of objects or values.

Dates and Times
Compare dates and times, and perform calendar and time zone calculations.

Units and Measurement
Label numeric quantities with physical dimensions to allow locale-aware formatting and conversion between related units.

Data Formatting
Convert numbers, dates, measurements, and other values to and from locale-aware string representations.

Filters and Sorting
Use predicates, expressions, and sort descriptors to examine elements in collections and other services.
